# 100 days of python
This is the 100 days of python challenge issued in the [100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2023](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/). 

I thought of doing this README to keep track of projects and notes for each one of them. 

## Day 28- Pomodoro Timer
Building the GUI in tkinter was HARD. I feel like I can still optimize the code and improve the readability. 
Issue: the restart button wont work. I'll try to check the `after_cancel()` method.
Update: I didn't declare the variable as global so that's why it didn't work!

## Day 29- Password Manager
I had an issue with buttons where you cant call the function as func() because then it wouldnt work!
Back in day 5 I built a passwor generator with more than 30 lines, and today, the whole function for this project is less than 5! I feel like im truly learning more each day :D

## Day 31- Flashcards (22/01/23)
I finished the flashcard project! It wasn't so hard except for tkinter, settng up the GUI is always an issue. Anyway, it was a fun project.

## Day 33 - ISS tracker (26/01/23)
This was such a fun project! There's an issue which I haven't had the time to fix, where the program will send several times an email when the ISS is above you. 
Anyway, to use it for your convenience, i had some variables to fill in with your own data. such as:
`my_lat = 0 #fill with your lat`
`my_lon = 0 #fill wwith your lon`
`your_city = "" #fill with your city`
`list_mails = () #fill with a list of emails you would like to send to the notifications`
`test_email = "" #Fill this with your email from which you will send the notifications`
`pwd_email = "" #Email password`

## Day 34 - Quizzler App (26/01/23)
Apis are awesome. Try the game for yourself!

* Bugs in the trivia game make it so that you can click the buttons and increase your score. Have to fix.
