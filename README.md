# 100 days of python
This is the 100 days of python challenge issued in the [100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2023](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/). 

I thought of doing this README to keep track of projects and notes for each one of them. 

## Day 28- Pomodoro Timer
Building the GUI in tkinter was HARD. I feel like I can still optimize the code and improve the readability. 
Issue: the restart button wont work. I'll try to check the `after_cancel()` method.
Update: I didn't declare the variable as global so that's why it didn't work!

## Day 29- Password Manager
I had an issue with buttons where you cant call the function as func() because then it wouldnt work!
Back in day 5 I built a passwor generator with more than 30 lines, and today, the whole function for this project is less than 5! I feel like im truly learning more each day :D

## Day 31- Flashcards (22/01/23)
I finished the flashcard project! It wasn't so hard except for tkinter, settng up the GUI is always an issue. Anyway, it was a fun project.

## Day 33 - ISS tracker (26/01/23)
This was such a fun project! There's an issue which I haven't had the time to fix, where the program will send several times an email when the ISS is above you. 
Anyway, to use it for your convenience, i had some variables to fill in with your own data. such as:
`my_lat = 0 #fill with your lat`
`my_lon = 0 #fill wwith your lon`
`your_city = "" #fill with your city`
`list_mails = () #fill with a list of emails you would like to send to the notifications`
`test_email = "" #Fill this with your email from which you will send the notifications`
`pwd_email = "" #Email password`

## Day 34 - Quizzler App (26/01/23)
Apis are awesome. Try the game for yourself!

## Day 36 - Stock tracker
Trys are exceptional. Truly a life saver. A probable bug could arise in the event of no news related to the stock! Should check it out.

## Day 37 - Habit Tracker Api (31/01/23)
Today I kept learning about apis, but most importantly, that you can format the date in the datetime module. Time saver.

## Day 38 - Workout tracker (06/02/23)
Remember sheety api, great resource.

## Day 39 - 40 - Flight Tracker (09/02/23)
Im going to leave this project on standby. It needs a Flight price tracker api, and the one recommended by the course (kiwi/tequila) wont work for me. If I find another api to replace this I will jump back to the project.

## Day 41 - 44 - HTML and CSS
I jumped over these lessons because I already worked on them on the Web dev bootcamp :)

## Day 45 - 100 Movies web scraping (09/02/23)
Web scraping is a very useful tool, this was a good exercise to remind myself how to obatin data from html using beautifulsoup(Aka. the GOAT)

## Day 46 - Spotify Time Machine (13/02/23)
I lost a lot of time during authentication. It was easily the worst part of this project. Note to self, check the documentation and redirect urls!

## Day 47 - Amazon Price Tracker (14/02/23)
Happy valentines day! It is pretty much done except for the fact that the auth wont work when I try to send the mail. I believe It might be because Im doing this from my university's network. I'll try again later and see if it works.

## Day 48 - Cookie Selenium Bot (17/02/2023)

Selenium is such a great tool. And code can be optimized by proper html understanding. Can't wait to see what else I do with this new knowledge.

## Day 49 - Linkedin Job Searcher (19/02/2023)
For some reason I cannot go foward. Whenever you lookup for a job in the linkedin searchbar, you cannot press enter to proceed. This is because another searchbar opens when you write the job listing you are looking for, one for location. The problem is that through reading the html, the searchbar is technically the same? And for some reason I cannot access it u.u . I'll try in a later date this challenge, for now it seems that html is an issue.

## Day 50 - Tinder auto swiper bot (19/02/2023)
I didnt feel comfortable doing this one so I skipped it lol.

## Day 53 - Zillow data extraction (20/02/2023)
Fun to do. I feel like I can obtain more data If I can handle to click the next page.

## Day 54 -- Flask introduction (21/02/2023)
More than a project, today was about learning flask basics and function decorators.

* Bugs in the trivia game make it so that you can click the buttons and increase your score. Have to fix.
