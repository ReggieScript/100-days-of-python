Hey!
I thought of doing this README to keep track of projects and
notes for each one of them.

Day 28- Pomodoro Timer
Building the GUI in tkinter was HARD. I feel like I can still 
optimize the code and improve the readability. 
Issue: the restart button wont work. I'll try to check the after_cancel()method.
