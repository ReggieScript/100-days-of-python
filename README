# 100 days of python
This is the 100 days of python challenge issued in the [100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2023](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/). 

I thought of doing this README to keep track of projects and notes for each one of them. 

## Day 28- Pomodoro Timer
Building the GUI in tkinter was HARD. I feel like I can still optimize the code and improve the readability. 
Issue: the restart button wont work. I'll try to check the after_cancel()method.
Update: I didn't declare the variable as global so that's why it didn't work!

## Day 29- Password Manager
I had an issue with buttons where you cant call the function as func() because then it wouldnt work!
Back in day 5 I built a passwor generator with more than 30 lines, and today, the whole function for this project is less than 5! I feel like im truly learning more each day :D

## Day 31- Flashcards (22/01/23)
I finished the flashcard project! It wasn't so hard except for tkinter, settng up the GUI is always an issue. Anyway, it was a fun project.
